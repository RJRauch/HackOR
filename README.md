File Zeus is a simple utility written in python to automate the addition of headers and footers to documents in batches. The five steps, as promised, are:

1. Enter the absolute path of the directory where the file are located.
2. Answer if you are interested in adding a header.
3. (if yes) - Enter the text of your header.
4. Answer if you are interested in adding a footer.
5. (if yes) - Enter the text of your footer.

_Et Voila!_ - your files have been modified.
